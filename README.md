This is a pretty basic plugin, only doing what it says.

Built against Java 21. Anything lower probably won't work.
Built against Spigot API version 1.21. Anything 1.21.x will *(probably?)* work.

Untested for compatibility with more complex plugins that handle stuff with the chat/signs, though it'll
probably be fine.

If there is a problem just submit a new issue I guess
